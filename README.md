# Start-Project

<p>Start your new project hassle free</p>

---

### Idea
When you start coding a project, you'll need to make a directory, do a git init, go to github and make a new repo, add git remote make a todo and a readme all that stuff
Isn't it too much work?

Well, you can just use `start-project`
